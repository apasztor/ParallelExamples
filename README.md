# ParallelExamples

This repository contains example programs for parallel programming with several different
libraries. So far this includes OpenMP and MPI. If I can keep my motivation going, CUDA is
also coming soon. My purpose in creating these example programs is purely educational.  

If you are completely new to parallel programming I recommend starting with OpenMP, and after
going through the OpenMP examples continuing with either MPI or CUDA.

The examples of parallel programming are written in C99, mainly because this makes them
readable to the widest possible set of audience. 

Some examples include some helper scripts for visualization, data analysis. These are either 
bash shell scripts, python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

## OpenMP Examples
 1. Pi by area
 2. Pi by Monte Carlo

## MPI Examples
 1. Parallel Matrix Times Vector
 2. Parallel Matrix Times Matrix
 3. Parallel Matrix
